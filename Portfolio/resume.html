      <p>On top of being a Web Developer, I'm the Marketing Coordinator for The Roasterie, which is a specialty coffee producer based out of Kansas City. I am also an assistant coach for the Hogan Prepatory Academy High School Basketball team.</p><br>
      <p>I enjoy trying to create new business ideas that can have a positive impact on people's daily lives. I am very ambitious and want to make an impact on a grand scale. I like to be in the company of like minded people who push me to continue to develop as a person.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From.</h1>
      <p>I was born in Chicago but raised in Kansas City. I lived on the Kansas side of the Kansas City, Missouri Metropolitan area, which continues to confuse people. Like most Kansas Citians, I enjoy BBQ and sports.</p><br>
      <p>I have two sisters (ages 20 and 12) and a brother (age 9) who are some of the most incredible people I know and they impress me daily.</p><br>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Tulsa in 2013 with degrees in Marketing, Business Mangagement specializing in Entrepreneurship and received a Certificate in Nonprofit Management.</p>
